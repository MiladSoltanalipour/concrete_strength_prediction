# Know more

If you want to know about this program, it predicts the concrete compressive strength depending on its age. It is based on Eurocode-2 Design of Concrete Structures - Part 1-1: General rules and rules for buildings, Clause 3.1.2 part (6). The concrete compressive strength is estimated if the following 3 items are available:

Mean concrete compressive strength at 28 days, Age of the concrete in days, and Coefficient depending on the cement type.

The advantage of this program is that the dates can be picked by a calendar widget.
