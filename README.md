If you want to know about this program, it predicts the concrete compressive strength depending on its age. It is based on Eurocode-2 Design of Concrete Structures - Part 1-1: General rules and rules for buildings, Clause 3.1.2 part (6). The concrete compressive strength is estimated if the following 3 items is available:

Mean concrete compressive strength at 28 days, Age of the concrete in days and Coefficient depedning on the cement type

The advantage of this proram is that the dates can be picked by a calender widget.
