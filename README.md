# How the program works

This program predicts the concrete compressive strength depending on its age.

It is based on Eurocode-2 Design of Concrete Structures - Part 1-1: General rules and rules for buildings, Clause 3.1.2 part (6). According to this clause, the concrete compressive strength is estimated if the following 3 items are available:

Mean concrete compressive strength at 28 days, Age of the concrete in days, and Coefficient depending on the cement type.

This program has a calendar widget that makes your prediction easy.
